        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>The story of Ibanez is one of rapid dominance and near constant reinvention. Many of us know the recent
             history of the company’s shred-friendly models and have owned an RG or S-Series guitar in our time. 
             However, the Ibanez story starts much earlier, in 1908, with a company called Hoshino Gakki, a sheet 
             music and music-products distributor in Nagoya, Japan.</p>
        <p>The 1980s saw a huge shift in guitar-driven music, and the traditional designs of Gibson and Fender 
            felt limited to players who wanted more speed and playability. With Edward Van Halen popularizing 
            the Frankenstein Fat Strat and Floyd Rose vibrato system, Ibanez filled the void left by traditional 
            manufacturers. Ibanez’s Saber and Roadstar guitars, which later become the S and RG series, sported the
             features that players demanded: high-output pickups, floating double-locking trems, thin necks and deep
              cutaways. High profile endorsers also were allowed to spec completely original models, a move very 
              rare in guitar production. Steve Vai and Joe Satriani were able to create very popular models that were 
              driven by artist needs, not marketing men, which made Ibanez unique in the field. Ibanez also was very
               quick to endorse other new shredders of the time, like Paul Gilbert of Mr. Big. and Racer X, and jazz 
               players, including Frank Gambale of the Chick Corea Elektric Band and Return to Forever, Pat Metheny 
               and George Benson. </p><br>
